    <h1>The Most Dangerous Animal in the World: The Lion</h1>
    <p>Lions, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," are among the most dangerous animals on the planet. These majestic creatures are native <br>
        to Africa and parts of Asia, where they roam the savannas and grasslands in prides. Despite their beauty and regal stature, lions are incredibly <br>
         dangerous due to their strength, speed, and hunting prowess.</p>
    <h2>Key Characteristics:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Strength and Size: Adult male lions can weigh up to 420 pounds and measure over 8 feet in length, including their tail.</li>
        <li>Social Structure: Lions are unique among big cats for their social behavior, living in groups called prides.</li>
        <li>Hunting Skills: Lions are apex predators, relying on teamwork to hunt large prey like wildebeests and zebras.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lions play a crucial role in their ecosystems by maintaining the balance of species populations. However, they face threats from habitat loss <br>
         and human conflict, making conservation efforts vital for their survival.</p>
